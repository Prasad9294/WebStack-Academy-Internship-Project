# Food Delivery App (MERN Stack)

## Overview

This project is a full-stack food delivery application developed during my internship at Webstack Academy. The app enables users to browse restaurants, view menus, add items to their cart, place orders, and manage their order history. Built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, the application offers a seamless and interactive user experience for ordering food online.
